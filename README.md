# Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) Digital Infrastructure - Group 7

A secure shell scripting solution for managing and analyzing data from critical hospital sensors, including Heart Rate, Temperature, and Water Usage monitoring.

---

## Project Objective

This project aims to:

- Automate hospital environment setup using Shell Scripts.
- Secure sensitive medical logs through Linux permissions.
- Analyze critical sensor readings and generate reports.
- Archive logs with timestamps for record keeping.
---

## Project Overview

The system uses a Python-based data simulator (`hospital_system.py`) to generate sensor data.

Our shell scripts perform the following tasks:

- **hospital_admin.sh** → Creates directories and applies security permissions.
- **hospital_analysis.sh** → Detects critical patient readings and analyzes water usage.
- **hospital_archive.sh** → Archives logs and recreates fresh log files.
